BukkitIRCd
=============

This plugin was [originally](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/bukkitircd) by Jdbye. As he hasn't touched it in months, we decided to make some edits of our own.

What we are trying to do is continue the work of Jdbye. We are starting off with a few minor fixes that we've noticed are needed for this plugin to continue functioning.

If you know how to code in Java, then by all means take a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/nathanblaney/BukkitIRCd/issues) page and submit a Pull Request with code additions as required. We're going to need all the support and teamwork we can muster.

### Plugin Developers

If you'd like to join the team, let us know and we'll happily add you.

### Extra Notes

This development is mainly for the benifit of the [Worldwide Minecraft Alliance](http://wma.im), an Australian multi-feature server hosted in Sydney, Australia.
